#### <h3 align="center">Theme scheduling for the KDE Plasma Desktop 

Koi is a program designed to provide the KDE Plasma Desktop functionality to automatically switch between light and dark themes. Koi is under active development, and while it is stable enough to use daily, expect bugs. Koi is designed to be used with Plasma, and while some features may function under different desktop environments, they are unlikely to work and untested.
***Built upon QT5/KF5.***

*Disclaimer: Koi was written as a project to practice QT by a novice programmer, expect code to be written sloppily.*

#### Install:

```
kcp -i koi
```
